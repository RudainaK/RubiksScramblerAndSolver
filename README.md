# Description
This is still a work in progress, but essentially what I'm aiming to do is 2 things: 
1) Expand the functionality of the [scrambler](https://github.com/RudainaK/RubiksCubeScrambler) to be displayed graphically (for now, through the terminal).
2) Solve the cube in its scrambled state. 


# The scrambler
In many online scrambles, you will see the following:



My program displays this in the terminal using characters to correspond to colors

### Colors
|Color |Letter |
|------|-------|
|Blue  |B      |
|Green |G      |
|Red   |R      |
|Orange|O      |
|Yellow|Y      |
|White |W      | *

*Note that this is based off of the more common color schemes general seen on cubes. Somnetimes cubes can have different color schemes
